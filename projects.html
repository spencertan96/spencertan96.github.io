                <p>A Rhythm/Bullet Hell Hybrid 2D game, inspired by the Touhou Project games with a Rhythm element added into the mix!
                    <br><br>
                    Players move with the mouse and collect ammo by interacting with "beats" at the appropriate timing.
                    <br><br>
                    There are enemies and bosses to defeat which fill the screen with enemy projectiles that the player will have to avoid <em>(in classic Touhou fashion)</em>!
                    Players have to balance attacking and avoid the projectiles being shot at them.

                    This was a group project made for the <em>NM3216 Game Design</em> module in National University of Singapore. 
                    We used the <em>Gamemaker Studio 2</em>  engine, and the implementation was done by me and 2 of my groupmates. 
                    It took us approximately 2 months to implement the game, and I worked on it after the semester for about 1-2 months to add a few features.
                    <br><br>
                    My groupmates were in charge of the art assets, beats spawning and enemy behavior while I worked on the rest, namely player abilities and interactions, user interface, tutorials and miscellaneous stuff.

                <p>A C# Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application, purposed as a database for keeping track of treatments with additional analysis capabilities.
                    <br><br>
                    The basic features are <strong><u>adding</u></strong> treatment records with a <em>Diagnosis</em>, <em>Symptoms</em> and <em>Treatments</em> along with the <em>Effectiveness</em> of the treatments.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to that, users can also <strong><u>search</u></strong> for specific records. It can also view the list of diagnoses, symptoms and treatments recorded in the database, with some statistics!

                    <br><br>
                    Some features were added to make record-adding more efficient, being able to add records easily through intentionally designed <u>tab-based navigation</u>.
                    <br><br>
                    Additional notes can also be added to records, diagnoses or symptoms for users to remember important information.

            <p>A Python script to visualize paths, done as a personal project.
                <br><br>
                It requires 2 input files for visualisation, 1 being the image to use, while the other being the point graph that will be used to create the paths.
                <br><br>
                There are a few algorithms used to generate paths and it can be cycled through to see the different paths that each generates.
                Currently, there is the <b>Greedy algorithm</b> and the <b>Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm</b>.
            </p>

            <img src="images/sample_result_dijkstra_bezier_adjusted.png" class="project-img left-img">
            <p id="p-right">Bezier curves can also be used to make the paths more natural looking! 
                Without it, generated paths would just be a sequence of straight lines and look really unnatural.
                <br><br>
                Also, there is a feature to shift the paths such that they don't intersect with other members. 
                An example is the image on the left/above!
                <br><br>
                Lastly, I added a feature to save the current generated path, so that future paths will always be a different permutation from the saved path.

            <h1>Playing around in Unity</h1>
            <div class="project-tag tag-project"><b>PROJECT</b></div>
            <p>Having already learnt and messed around with <em>Unreal Engine</em> in university, I decided to try out the other big engine, <em>Unity</em>!
                I wanted to try and make a pretty environment and decided to attempt to create a waterfall and a lake.
                <br><br>
                I experimented with <strong>Unity Shader Graphs</strong> to make the shaders for the waterfall and the water surface.
                An example of the water surface shader is on the right/below! 
                I scrolled 2 textures in different directions to get the ripple animation on the water, with <strong>vertex displacement</strong> to simulate waves!
            </p>
            <img src="images/unity_shader_graph.png" class="project-img">
            <img src="images/waterfall_blend.png" class="project-img left-img" id="waterfall">
            <p id="p-right">For the waterfall, I used Blender to create the waterfall mesh, shown left/above!
                Then I used Unity's <strong>Particle System</strong> to simulate the water splashes at the bottom of the waterfall.
                <br><br>
                I had to make sure the UV mapping was regular so that when I scrolled the texture to simulate falling water,
                it would look realistic. 
                <br><br>
                I was pretty satisfied with the results! There are definitely things to improve and add on but I learnt quite a bit about how to approach and implement the concepts.
