                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.tatsu.works/">Tatsu Works</a> is the creator of the widely used <span id="terms">Discord</span> bot <a href="https://top.gg/bot/172002275412279296">Tatsu</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    It is used in more than <span id="emphasis">1,400,000</span> Discord servers and helps online Discord communities engage their community members by providing them with <span id="emphasis">games</span> and <span id="emphasis">utilities</span>.
                    The main selling point of Tatsu is the <span id="terms">Tatsugotchi</span> game, based on the popular <span id="terms">Tamagotchi</span> fad where users can <span id="terms">collect pets</span>, customize their own houses with more than a <span id="emphasis">1000</span> different pieces of furniture.
                    <br><br>
                    Tatsu also provides comprehensive utilities such as <span id="emphasis">moderation features</span> for server moderators and rewards members for activity in the Discord servers.
                    They are currently developing an <span id="terms">idle MMORPG</span> within Discord, <a href="https://tatsumeeko.com/">Tatsumeeko</a>, whose initial concept design I had also been involved in during my time there.
                    <br><br>
                    My main responsibility as a Backend API Developer during my internship was the <span id="emphasis">implementation of API endpoints</span> for Tatsu, using <span id="terms">Node.js</span>.
                    In addition, I was also involved in the <span id="emphasis">game design</span> and <span id="emphasis">implementation</span> for multiple events, 
                    namely <a href="https://medium.com/tatsuworks/our-very-first-player-event-21091cc959f6">Tatsu's Launch Event</a> and the <a href="https://medium.com/tatsuworks/starlight-festival-2020-player-mail-basic-auto-mod-845a22d11524">Starlight Festival 2020</a>.

                <p id="p-right">For both the <span id="terms">Launch Event</span> and the <span id="terms">Starlight Festival</span>, there were a bunch of <span id="emphasis">limited-time mini-games</span> added to Tatsu, along with limited pets and cosmetics. 
                    The <span id="emphasis">design</span> of the mini-games were decided after <span id="emphasis">team brainstorming sessions</span> that I was a part of, before each of them were delegated to different developers. 
                    <br><br>
                    I was in charge of <span id="emphasis">implementing</span> the <span id="terms">Daily Spinner</span> and <span id="terms">Greench</span> <em>(wordplay on the fictional character, the Grinch)</em> mini-games. I also <span id="emphasis">designed</span> the arrangement of the <span id="terms">Bingo Board</span>, balancing each line to make sure that task difficulties were spread out evenly. 
                    <br><br>
                    I was also given the task of <span id="emphasis">game economy balancing</span>. There was a <span id="terms">limited-time event shop</span> during the <span id="terms">Launch Event</span>, with limited pets and cosmetics on sale that players would buy with the <span id="emphasis">event currency</span> (earned through the mini-games).
                    I had to balance the <span id="terms">currency gain</span> from the mini-games with the prices of items in the shop - the <span id="terms">currency sink</span>. 
                    <br><br>
                    The goal was to ensure players of <u>different</u> participation levels would <span id="emphasis">ALL</span> have something they could afford in the shop and have <span id="emphasis">fun</span> choosing what they want and spending their currency.
                    The event turned out to be a resounding success, with <span id="emphasis">more than 110,000 users</span> involved in the <span id="terms">Treetsu</span> mini-game!  
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="experience-body">
                <p>Along with these events, new features were added to Tatsu. One of them was the <span id="terms">Mail system</span>.
                    I was tasked <span id="emphasis">alone</span> with this project, to design the <span id="emphasis">entire</span> system - both on the <span id="terms">database</span> side and the <span id="terms">backend</span>.
                    The <span id="emphasis">implementation</span> on the database would be done by a colleague, but the backend implementation would be done by me.
                    I designed how the database would <span id="emphasis">store</span> all the required information, down to the <span id="terms">data types</span> and <span id="terms">procedures</span> each call would do, along with the <span id="terms">backend functionality</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    Other than a slight hiccup with the database implementation, the design worked well! The system could handle sending mail to <span id="emphasis">ALL</span> users (with <span id="emphasis">hundreds of thousands</span> of users, this was <span id="terms">non-trivial</span> and needed to be handled) and mail to <span id="emphasis">specific</span> users.
                    I handled that concern by having a separate <span id="terms">"Global Mail"</span> and a <span id="terms">"Personal Mail"</span> where announcements would be stored in the Global Mail, which was stored in <span id="emphasis">1</span> location that all users would access.
                    This meant that there was <span id="emphasis">no duplication of data</span> and global mail would be have <span id="terms">O(1) space and time complexity</span>. 
                    When <span id="emphasis">individual</span> users handled the Global Mail, for example by deleting, reading or marking as unread, a separate <span id="terms">flag</span> would be set for each user (with defaults). 
                    <br><br>
                    Another sizeable feature I worked on was the <span id="emphasis">Moderation features</span>, namely the <span id="terms">infract</span>, <span id="terms">warn</span>, <span id="terms">prohibit</span> and <span id="terms">exception</span> commands.
                    It was added to make Tatsu a more <span id="emphasis">comprehensive</span> Discord bot, so that servers would not need to get a <span id="emphasis">separate</span> bot to deal with moderation unless they needed very specific features.
                    When enabled, Tatsu could <span id="emphasis">screen members' messages</span> and delete the message and warn or even remove them from the server if they contained any <span id="emphasis">offensive words</span>.
                    This required me to work with a <span id="terms">NoSQL</span> database, <span id="terms">Redis</span> that Tatsu Works used, a different one compared to the SQL database, <span id="terms">PostgreSQL</span> that I worked with in the Mail system.
                    At the time of writing, these moderation commands are <span id="emphasis">still</span> the ones used by Tatsu now!

                <p id="p-right" style="padding-bottom: 20px;">One other project that I was initially assigned was the <span id="emphasis">re-design</span> of the <span id="terms">basic text-based fishing game</span> they had in <span id="terms">Tatsu</span>.
                    As with the other games, we did some <span id="emphasis">brainstorming</span> as the game design team and came up with an <span id="emphasis">initial set of features</span> that the revamp should include. I was put in charge of the game mechanics design
                    and introduced to <a href="https://machinations.io/">Machinations</a>, a <span id="terms">game economy & systems design tool</span>. 
                    <br><br>
                    It's a tool that <span id="emphasis">simulates systems</span> such as players' <span id="terms">currency gain</span>, <span id="terms">damage calculation</span> that involves a significant amount of math and historically, <span id="emphasis">messy Excel spreadsheets</span> with complicated formulas.
                    I picked it up and used it for <span id="emphasis">preliminary design</span> on how the revamped fishing game's numbers would be calculated. 
                    <br><br>Check out my initial drafts on <span id="terms">fishing catch rates</span> on the <u>left/above</u>! 
                    I was experimenting with <span id="emphasis">different scalings</span> for the rates <span id="terms">(linear + Pokemon-based)</span> on Machinations. Sample results are shown on the graph! 
                    <br><br>
                    One of the <span id="terms">co-founders</span> of <span id="terms">Machinations</span>, Mihai, also took an interest <em>(from one of my queries while working on it)</em> and <span id="emphasis">featured my catch rate diagram</span> on the website! 
                    Even though the revamp was <span id="emphasis">postponed</span> to a future update because of the <span id="emphasis">urgent requirements</span> in developing the <span id="terms">events</span> above and bot features instead, I accrued <span id="terms">invaluable insights</span> from
                    discussing and planning the system that I'm sure will come to be useful in future projects.
                    <br><br>
                    Tatsu Works uses the <span id="terms">Agile methodology</span> and we had regular sprints where we <span id="emphasis">designated tasks</span> and <span id="emphasis">allocated task priorities</span> before assigning them to the respective developer.
                    We used <span id="terms">Trello</span> to keep track of tasks. It was my first experience with the Agile framework and I found it very useful in viewing our progress and checking what tasks we had left.
                    <br><br>
                    My time at Tatsu Works was <span id="emphasis">very busy</span> but also <span id="terms">fun</span> and <span id="terms">very fulfilling</span>! I learnt loads from the colleagues I worked with, about <span id="terms">different technologies</span> and how a team <span id="terms">collaborates</span> and works together.
                    I also got the opportunity to work on many projects where my work was <span id="emphasis">released to production</span> and entertained many users! Different areas were exposed to me, <span id="terms">designing games</span>, <span id="terms">balancing game economies and systems</span>,
                    working with <span id="terms">different databases</span>, <span id="terms">backend development</span> and <span id="emphasis">more</span>! 
                    <br><br>
                    I was approached to extend my internship into a <span id="emphasis">full or part-time</span> role but I wanted to prioritize my studies and 
                    so declined the offer. Even now, I'm sure it would have also been a great role, but I feel that the time wasn't right to accept it!

                <p><a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/">National Parks Board</a>, or <span id="terms">NParks</span> for short, is one of the <span id="emphasis">statutory boards</span> of the government of Singapore. 
                    They are the lead agency for <span id="terms">greenery</span>, <span id="terms">biodiversity conservation</span>, and <span id="terms">wildlife and animal health</span>, <span id="terms">welfare and management</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    I was posted to the <span id="terms">Plant Records Unit</span>. The unit is in charge of surveying, labelling and tracking the <span id="emphasis">living collections</span> in the <span id="terms">Singapore Botanic Gardens</span>.
                    With <span id="emphasis">thousands of species</span> of flora in the Gardens, this is no small task!
                    <br><br>
                    My <span id="terms">primary task</span> was to <span id="emphasis">migrate</span> their current ageing database to a new database.
                    This included the <span id="emphasis">analysis</span> of different prospective databases to come up with a <span id="emphasis">recommendation</span> on which would be the best option, 
                    and <span id="emphasis">exporting</span> of the current data.
                    <br><br>
                    Since there are <span id="emphasis">numerous</span> accesses and updates made to the database daily <em>(with the huge number of plants in the Gardens)</em>, one major consideration is that those processes should be <span id="terms">fast and streamlined</span>.
                    I looked into the regular tasks that my colleagues did to <span id="emphasis">understand</span> the processes and workflow. 
                    <br><br>
                    Also, different databases also differ in the <span id="terms">services</span> that they provide. 
                    For example, the <a href="https://herbaria.plants.ox.ac.uk/bol/">BRAHMS database</a> has an <span id="terms">in-built ARCGIS feature</span> <em>(a mapping solution)</em> that make it easy to map botanical collections
                    if the existing collection already utilizes some ARCGIS-compatible maps.

                <p id="p-right">Other than the database analysis, I also joined in a number of <span id="terms">physical surveys</span> of the plants in the Gardens with my colleagues. 
                    I noticed that in their <span id="terms">regular tasks</span> of identifying and labelling trees, they had to record and track data <span id="emphasis">on paper</span> before <span id="emphasis">manually</span> entering them into the database back in the office.
                    This was partly due to the remoteness of certain locations and <span id="emphasis">lack of Internet connectivity</span>, resulting in a <span id="emphasis">significant overhead</span> and loss of time. 
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, I set out to create a <span id="terms">HTML form</span> that could be used <span id="emphasis">offline</span> and could <span id="emphasis">automatically</span> convert collected data into an <span id="terms">Excel file</span>. 
                    Personnel could use the form to record data while <span id="terms">out in the field</span> and would not need to spend time <span id="emphasis">manually</span> transferring the data to the database.
                    I picked up some <span id="terms">HTML</span>, <span id="terms">CSS</span> and <span id="terms">Javascript</span> to do so and managed to create a <span id="terms">prototype form</span> that could accomplish this task.
                    <br><br>
                    Here is a <span id="terms">demo</span> of the prototype form on the <u>left/above</u>! Since this is just a <span id="emphasis">prototype</span>, it's pretty barebones and simply functional. 
                    Further improvements such as adding the ability to <span id="terms">view</span> added records, <span id="terms">editing</span> your entries can be done too!

                    In a functional botanic garden, making sure that all the <span id="terms">collected data</span> is <span id="emphasis">accurate</span> is essential. 
                    Any inaccuracies such as <span id="emphasis">mistyped</span> identification numbers can result in <span id="terms">"ghost"</span> specimens that exist in the database but <span id="emphasis">cannot</span> be found in the Gardens.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the other tasks I was given was to work on a <span id="terms">checksum algorithm</span>. 
                    Checksum algorithms are used to <span id="terms">detect errors</span> that occur during transmission or storage, mostly due to <span id="emphasis">human error</span>. 
                    This would reduce errors such as a <span id="terms">typo</span> in the accession number when a personnel entered new data into the database.

            <div class="experience-body">
                <p>I considered a few algorithms, the <span id="terms">Luhn</span>, <span id="terms">Verhoeff</span> and <span id="terms">Damm algorithms</span> and eventually selected the Luhn algorithm.
                    The other 2 algorithms were <span id="emphasis">more complex</span> and might take a <span id="emphasis">longer time</span> to process. 
                    Also, since <span id="terms">accession numbers</span>, which is what the checksum will be used for, 
                    contains <span id="emphasis">special characters</span> along with numbers, the <span id="terms">Luhn mod N algorithm</span> was chosen as it could handle special characters.
                    <br><br>
                    Here's my <span id="terms">implementation</span> of the Luhn mod N algorithm in <span id="terms">Visual Basic</span> on the <u>right/below</u>. 
                    I used <span id="emphasis">N = 39</span> as that is the total number of <span id="terms">possible</span> characters that can appear in a specimen's accession number.
                    <br><br>
                    To make sure that my <span id="terms">implementation</span> was correct, I created some <span id="emphasis">automated tests</span> in Excel using <span id="terms">Visual Basic</span> to check for the errors that the algorithm could not detect.
                    Since the algorithm was relatively simple, it <span id="emphasis">could not detect all errors</span> and <span id="terms">double transposition errors</span> <em>("103" instead of "301")</em> and a few <span id="terms">twin errors</span> <em>("99" mistyped as "22")</em> would pass. 
                    However, these errors are <span id="emphasis">very unlikely</span> and the <span id="terms">Luhn mod N algorithm</span> will be sufficiently strong enough to detect most human errors and <span id="terms">improve data integrity significantly</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    A GIF of my <span id="terms">conclusions</span> from the tests is on the <u>right/below</u>! As mentioned above, <span id="emphasis">double transposition errors</span> aren't caught. This is because Luhn's algorithm 
                    sums up the <span id="emphasis">all</span> digits <span id="terms">after doubling</span> the even digits. So if a digit is <span id="emphasis">accidentally swapped</span> with another <span id="terms">even</span> digit, the algorithm will not detect it.
                    <br><br>
                    Being my <span id="emphasis">first</span> foray into the workplace, my internship at <span id="terms">NParks</span> was a great starting point. 
                    Although it isn't a <span id="terms">software-focused</span> company, meaning that it could not teach me nor expose me to more <span id="emphasis">technical knowledge</span> for my field, I could still learn <span id="emphasis">non-technical</span> stuff!
                    It forced me to <span id="emphasis">self-learn</span> and research, picking up <span id="terms">HTML</span>, <span id="terms">CSS</span> and <span id="terms">Javascript</span> which I had not worked with before. 
                    Hearing from my colleagues' gripes about software also taught me that it is important for software to be built with the <span id="terms">user in mind</span>. 
                    Even if a program had the <span id="terms">functionality</span> to complete a task, if users found it <span id="emphasis">hard to navigate</span> and use the interface, it would <span id="emphasis">not</span> be a good program.
                    <br><br>
                    The <span id="terms">Botanic Gardens</span> was also a <span id="emphasis">very</span> pleasant place to work at. Being someone that <span id="terms">enjoys nature</span>, whenever I needed a break, I could relax and walk around the Gardens to clear my mind.
                    My colleagues were also very <span id="emphasis">passionate</span> people <em>(which I suppose comes from the closeness they work with flora)</em> and <span id="terms">inspired</span> me to put my all into my work!
